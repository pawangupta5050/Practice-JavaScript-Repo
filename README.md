# Learning MERN Stack and JavaScript Roadmap

Welcome to my learning journey in mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and JavaScript! This repository contains the code and projects I have developed while following a comprehensive roadmap to enhance my skills in full-stack web development.

## Roadmap Overview
I have structured my learning process by following this roadmap, which covers various modules and topics:
1. JavaScript Basics
   - Read a JavaScript beginner's guide or tutorial
   - Complete interactive exercises to practice JavaScript fundamentals
   - Implement simple JavaScript programs and scripts

2. Introduction to Node.js
   - Explore Node.js documentation and official website
   - Follow online tutorials for setting up Node.js development environment
   - Build a basic Node.js server and experiment with HTTP requests

3. Introduction to Express.js
   - Study Express.js documentation and official website
   - Follow step-by-step tutorials on building RESTful APIs with Express.js
   - Create a sample project using Express.js for hands-on experience

4. Introduction to MongoDB
   - Refer to MongoDB documentation and resources
   - Set up a local MongoDB database for testing and development
   - Learn CRUD operations with MongoDB and integrate it with Node.js

5. Introduction to React
